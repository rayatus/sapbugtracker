===ZBT_COMPONT===	
Different components that divides a same product.

===ZBT_CONFIG===

===ZBT_ESTADO===
Different status for that can be applied to a bug (not only bug types but also improvements, etc...) for instance:

* Open
* In development
* User validation
* Closed

===ZBT_ESTADO_HIER===
It allows to define from which status can be moved a "bug" to a different status.

===ZBT_PRODUCTO_TAG===
Allows to define different tags for a given product. All tags will be added to the transport request in order to provide traceability directly in the transport request, for instance: customer's ticket....

===ZBT_USUARIO===
To define which is your team and who is the reporter, assignee, tester and developer, also allows to store the eMail for notification purposes.

===ZBT_WORKCONCEPT===
In order to allow managing the spent time during a "bug" resolution here you could differentiate all the different categories for which you want to compute worked hours.
This part is under developement.
